I am honored to receive the Best Paper Award at the 4th International Conference on Advances in Communication Technology and Computer Engineering (ICACTCE'24) for our paper "Securing O-RAN with Zero Trust Architecture and Large Language Models."

This research addresses critical security challenges in Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) environments, particularly focusing on the integration of untrusted third-party applications (xApps) within the near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). Our work demonstrates how Zero Trust Architecture principles combined with Large Language Models can enhance security in next-generation telecommunications infrastructure.

The recognition highlights the importance of developing robust security frameworks for emerging 5G and beyond network architectures, where traditional security perimeters are no longer sufficient.
