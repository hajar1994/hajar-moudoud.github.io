This research addresses the security challenges in Internet of Drones (IoD) networks by proposing a novel reputation-aware scheduling mechanism powered by federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The approach enables drones to collaboratively learn and maintain trust relationships while optimizing task scheduling and resource allocation.

The framework incorporates reputation metrics to assess the trustworthiness of individual drones, enabling secure and efficient coordination in dynamic IoD environments where traditional centralized security mechanisms are impractical.
