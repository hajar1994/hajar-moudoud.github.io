This research proposes an innovative framework that combines blockchain technology with federated learning to enhance collaborative intrusion detection in vehicular edge computing environments. The approach enables secure and privacy-preserving collaboration between vehicles for threat detection.

The solution addresses the unique security challenges in connected vehicle networks by maintaining the integrity and reliability of the detection system through blockchain consensus mechanisms while ensuring data privacy through federated learning principles. The framework achieves high accuracy in intrusion detection while maintaining the scalability requirements of vehicular networks.
