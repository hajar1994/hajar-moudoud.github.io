This research investigates the convergence of federated learning and blockchain technology to address security challenges in metaverse environments. The work proposes novel mechanisms for ensuring privacy-preserving collaborative learning while maintaining the immersive experience of virtual worlds.

The approach demonstrates how blockchain's decentralized consensus can be combined with federated learning's privacy-preserving properties to create secure, scalable solutions for metaverse applications, including virtual reality interactions, digital asset management, and user behavior analysis.
