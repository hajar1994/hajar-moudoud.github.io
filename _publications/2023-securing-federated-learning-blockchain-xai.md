This research, presented at the prestigious IEEE INFOCOM 2023 conference, introduces a novel framework that combines explainable AI (XAI) with blockchain technology to enhance federated learning security for IoT intrusion detection. The work addresses the critical need for transparent and interpretable AI decisions in cybersecurity applications.

The proposed approach provides not only robust intrusion detection capabilities but also explanations for AI-driven security decisions, enabling network administrators to understand and trust the automated security responses in IoT environments.
