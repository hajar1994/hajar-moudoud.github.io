This research introduces an innovative federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (FMA-DRL) approach to address security and trust challenges in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The proposed framework enables distributed learning among sensor nodes while maintaining data privacy and improving collective security decision-making.

The approach leverages the collaborative intelligence of multiple agents to detect and respond to various security threats in WSNs, including intrusion attempts, data falsification, and node compromise, while ensuring scalability and energy efficiency.
