This research addresses the critical security and reliability challenges in federated learning systems by proposing a blockchain-based framework. The work explores how blockchain technology can be leveraged to ensure model integrity, prevent malicious attacks, and maintain trust in distributed learning environments.

The proposed approach provides mechanisms for verifying model updates, detecting byzantine participants, and maintaining a tamper-proof record of the federated learning process, thereby enhancing the overall security and reliability of collaborative machine learning systems.
