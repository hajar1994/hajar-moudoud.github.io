This research presents an innovative approach for detecting and predicting False Data Injection (FDI) attacks in IoT systems using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The proposed method leverages temporal patterns and state transitions in IoT data streams to identify anomalous behaviors indicative of FDI attacks.

The framework demonstrates superior performance in terms of detection accuracy and false positive rates compared to traditional intrusion detection methods, while maintaining real-time processing capabilities essential for IoT applications. The work contributes significantly to the field of IoT security analytics.
