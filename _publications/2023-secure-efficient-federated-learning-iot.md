This research addresses the dual challenges of security and efficiency in federated learning systems applied to IoT intrusion detection. The work proposes novel mechanisms that ensure both the privacy of participating IoT devices and the effectiveness of collaborative threat detection.

The framework demonstrates how federated learning can be optimized for IoT environments while maintaining robust security properties, enabling scalable intrusion detection across large IoT deployments without compromising individual device privacy or overall system performance.
