This research focuses on strengthening the security posture of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) by implementing Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) principles enhanced with deep learning capabilities. The work addresses the unique security challenges introduced by the open and disaggregated nature of O-RAN.

The proposed framework provides continuous monitoring, threat detection, and automated response capabilities that adapt to the dynamic nature of modern wireless networks while maintaining the performance and flexibility benefits of O-RAN architecture.
