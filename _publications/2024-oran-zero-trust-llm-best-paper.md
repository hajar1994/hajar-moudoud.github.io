**üèÜ Best Paper Award Winner**

This award-winning research presents a groundbreaking approach to securing Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) by integrating zero trust architecture principles with Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed framework leverages the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs to enhance threat intelligence, automate security policy generation, and provide intelligent incident response.

The approach demonstrates how AI-powered security mechanisms can adapt to the dynamic and complex nature of O-RAN environments, providing autonomous threat detection and mitigation capabilities that scale with network complexity.
