This research addresses critical security vulnerabilities in 5G-enabled IoT networks by developing sophisticated methods for predicting and detecting False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The work leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic patterns and identify malicious activities.

The proposed framework provides real-time threat detection capabilities while maintaining the performance requirements of 5G networks, making it particularly valuable for securing large-scale IoT deployments in next-generation wireless environments.
