This research presents a comprehensive framework that combines blockchain technology with Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) to create a decentralized zero-trust security architecture for 6G and beyond networks. The work addresses the fundamental security challenges in next-generation wireless systems.

The proposed framework leverages blockchain's decentralized consensus mechanisms to implement zero-trust principles across O-RAN components, ensuring continuous verification and enhanced resilience against sophisticated cyber threats in future wireless networks.
