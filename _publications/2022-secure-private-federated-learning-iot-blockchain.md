This research investigates how blockchain technology can be leveraged to enhance the security and privacy guarantees of federated learning systems in IoT environments. The work addresses the unique challenges of maintaining privacy while enabling collaborative learning across resource-constrained IoT devices.

The proposed approach uses blockchain's immutability and consensus mechanisms to ensure the integrity of federated learning processes while providing additional privacy protections through cryptographic techniques tailored for IoT constraints.
