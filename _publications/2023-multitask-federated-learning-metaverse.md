This research investigates the intersection of multi-tasking federated learning and blockchain technology to address trust and security challenges in metaverse environments. The work proposes a novel framework that enables secure and privacy-preserving collaborative learning across multiple metaverse applications.

The approach demonstrates how federated learning can be enhanced with blockchain's immutability and transparency features to create a robust security infrastructure for virtual worlds, ensuring user privacy while maintaining the quality of shared AI models in metaverse applications.
