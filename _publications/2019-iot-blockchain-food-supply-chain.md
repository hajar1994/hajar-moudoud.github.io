This seminal work presents a comprehensive IoT blockchain architecture that leverages oracles and smart contracts to address transparency, traceability, and security challenges in food supply chains. The research demonstrates how blockchain technology can be effectively integrated with IoT sensors to create an end-to-end solution for food safety verification.

The proposed architecture enables real-time monitoring of food products throughout the supply chain while ensuring data integrity and providing automated compliance verification through smart contracts. This work has become highly cited in the blockchain-IoT integration domain.
