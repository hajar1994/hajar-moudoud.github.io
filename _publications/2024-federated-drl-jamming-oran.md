This research addresses the critical security challenge of jamming attacks in Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) by proposing a federated deep reinforcement learning solution. The approach enables distributed learning across multiple network nodes to develop coordinated anti-jamming strategies.

The framework leverages the collaborative intelligence of federated learning while using deep reinforcement learning to adapt to dynamic jamming patterns, providing more efficient and robust defense mechanisms for next-generation wireless networks.
