This research proposes a comprehensive zero trust security architecture tailored for 6G Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN). The work addresses the fundamental security challenges introduced by the open and disaggregated nature of ORAN, where traditional perimeter-based security models are insufficient.

The proposed architecture implements continuous verification, least privilege access, and micro-segmentation principles to ensure robust security in the dynamic and heterogeneous 6G network environment.
