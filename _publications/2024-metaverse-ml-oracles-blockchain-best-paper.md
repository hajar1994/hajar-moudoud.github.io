**üèÜ Best Paper Award Winner**

This prestigious award-winning research investigates the critical intersection of machine learning-based oracles and blockchain technology for securing metaverse environments. The work addresses the unique security challenges posed by immersive virtual worlds, where traditional security paradigms are insufficient.

The proposed framework utilizes intelligent oracles powered by machine learning algorithms to provide real-time security assessments and automated threat responses, while blockchain technology ensures the integrity and immutability of security policies and incident logs in the metaverse ecosystem.
