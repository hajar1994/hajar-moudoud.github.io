This collaborative research between University of North Dakota, Universit√© de Sherbrooke, and University of Dubai presents an innovative approach to supply chain security by integrating blockchain technology with zero trust principles and deep reinforcement learning.

The framework provides adaptive security mechanisms that can learn from evolving threat patterns in supply chain environments while maintaining the transparency and immutability benefits of blockchain technology. The zero trust approach ensures continuous verification of all supply chain participants and transactions.
